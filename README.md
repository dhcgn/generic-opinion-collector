## Use Cases

### Simple

1. The role "campaign creator" goes to the dashboard and creates a new campaign.
2. The campaign creator sets up the campaign details, such as the campaign name, tracing details, description, and privacy settings.
3. The campaign creator customizes the web form. This may include adding questions, setting response types, and configuring privacy settings.
4. The campaign creator shares the web form link with participants
5. Participants submit their written opinions, poll responses, or survey answers through the web form, which is then stored in the backend system for further analysis and reporting.
   1. They can choose which tracing details they want to share
6. The campaign creator can monitor the campaign's progress and live events through the dashboard.
7. Once the campaign is complete, the campaign creator can generate insights and reports based on the collected user opinions and associated metadata.
